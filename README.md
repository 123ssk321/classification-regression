# Classification and Regression

This project solves a classification problem (fake banknote detection) and a regression problem (distance between two objects in space at the time of closest approach of an encounter). The classification problem is solved by parametrizing, fitting, and comparing Naive Bayes classifiers implemented using Kernel Density Estimation. The regression problem is solved by using and comparing regressors from the `scikit-learn` Python library. The project is done on behalf of the Machine Learning course.
